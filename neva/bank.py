"""Bank represented through its balance sheet and valuation functions.

The balance sheet of the bank consists of assets and liabilities, both of
which can be either external or interbank. Interbank assets and liabilites are 
towards other banks:

    A_ij : money that bank i loaned to bank j, 

which is an asset for bank i. A corresponding liability L_ji = A_ij exists in 
the balance sheet of bank j, so that:

    L_i^{ib} = \sum_j L_ij: aggregate interbank liabilities of bank i.

External assets and liabilities are towards entities not belonging to the 
banking system:

    A_i^e : aggregate external assets of bank i,
    L_i^e : aggregate external liabilities of bank i.

Therefore, the face (or book) value of the equity of bank i is:

    E_i = A_i^e - L_i^e + \sum_j A_ij - L_i^{ib} .

Liabilities have the following priorities (from the most senior to the most 
junior): external, interbank, equity. The mark-to-market valuation of external 
assets of bank i is: 

    A_i^e * V_i^e(E_i) ,

where V_i^e (E_i) is the external valuation function for bank i and it takes 
values in the real interval [0, 1]. Similarly, the mark-to-market valuation of
interbank assets is:

    A_ij * V_ij(E_i, E_j) , 

where V_ij(E_i, E_j) is the full interbank valuation function for the couple 
of banks i and j and it also takes values in the real interval [0, 1]. Here 
the full interbank valuation function is factorised in following way: 

    V_ij(E_i, E_j) = ibeval_lender(E_i) * ibeval(E_j) ,

the lender interbank valuation function and the (proper) interbank valuation 
function. The former captures the dependence of the valuation of interbank 
assets on the equity of the lender, while the latter on the equity of the 
borrower.

The valuation of the equities is obtained as fixed point of the map: 

    E = \Phi(E) ,

where: 

    \Phi(E_i) =  A_i^e * V_i^e(E_i) - L_i^e +
                 + \sum_j A_ij * V_ij(E_i, E_j) - L_i^{ib} .
