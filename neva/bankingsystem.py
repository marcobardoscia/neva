    This container allows to perform operations that require access to data of
    all banks, such as checking the consistency of interbank assets and 
    liabilities and, more importantly, to compute the equity as a fixed-point 
    of an iterative map.

    Individual banks can be accessed either using `Bank`s objects: 

    >>> import bank
    >>> bank_a = bank.Bank(name='A')
    >>> bank_b = bank.Bank(name='B')
    >>> import bankingsystem
    >>> b_system = bankingsystem.BankingSystem([bank_a, bank_b])
    >>> b_system.banks[bank_a].name
    'A' 

    or by using indices. Banks are ordered as in the sequence passed to the
    `BankingSystem` constructor.

    >>> b_system[1].name
    'B'

    Finally banks can be accessed by name:
    
    >>> b_system.banksbyname[bank_b.name].name
    'B'

    `BankingSystem` also allows order-preserving iteration over banks:

    >>> for bank in b_system:
    >>>     print(bank.name)
    >>> 'A'
    >>> 'B' 

    Attributes:
        banks (OrderedDict of `Bank` : `Bank`): access to `Bank`s by `Bank`
        banksbyid (OrderedDict of int : `Bank`): access to `Bank`s by index
        banksbyname (OrderedDict of str : `Bank`): access to `Bank`s by `Bank.name`                      
        nbanks (int): number of banks
        tol (float): error tolerance for the convergence of the iterative map

                        banks, from the starting point until convergence
