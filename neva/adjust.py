    In general, once assets and liabilities (both external and interbank) of a

    naive value obtained by subtracting liabilities from assets. However, in a

        Similarly to `eval_equity`, external assets are evaluated iteratively,

        when it is possible to measure the equity, but not the external assets
        and a value of external assets consistent with the measured equity is 
        needed. The valuation of external assets should be performed

            The external assets of the bank are returned and not stored in 
            `Bank.extassets` because the map is updated syncronously.
