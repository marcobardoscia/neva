"""Valuation functions for external assets.

External assets are marked-to-market using external valuation functions:

    A_i^e * V_i^e(E_i) ,

where E_i is the equity of bank i, A_i^e is the face value of external assets 
of bank i, and V_i^e (E_i) is the external valuation function. Here the 
definition of the external valuation function is slightly different: 

    A_i^e * V_i^e(E_i) = exteval(E_i | A_i^e, L_i^e) ,

where L_i^e are the external liabilities of bank i.
